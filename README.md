## Requirements
* a Webcam with 640x480 pixel resolution
* Qt 4.5
* OpenCV 2.0

## Documentation
for the algorithmic and software architecture, refer to the [master thesis of Alexander KÃ¼hn](http://alexkuehn.github.io/blob/thesis_akuehn.pdf) (german only).

There is also a reference implementation [PLATAN](http://github.com/alexkuehn/platan), which reacts on eyelid events.
